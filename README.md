# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project was made to help student or aspiring coder that is about to start the bootcamp. The goal is to get them familiar with the different aspect of how a website runs. During the making of this project, I learned the different components of a website. How the HTML is the basic building block of a website. CSS is the "topping on a cake" for a website, and JavaScript gives a website it's interactivity. I also learned about Git. Git is a very powerful verson control program that a developer can use to control and manage their project. It allows for easy collaboration with multiple developers.

## Description

This project was made to help student or aspiring coder. The goal is to get them familiar with the different aspect of how a website runs. During the making of this project, I learned the different components of a website. How the HTML is the basic building block of a website. CSS is the "topping on a cake" for a website, and JavaScript gives a website it's interactivity. I also learned about Git. Git is a very powerful verson control program that a developer can use to control and manage their project. It allows for easy collaboration with multiple developers.
